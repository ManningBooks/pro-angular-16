# Typos for *Pro Angular 16*

This file contains smaller errors that are unlikely to prevent the code examples from working and which I will correct in the next edition of the book. See [this](errata.md) file for mistakes that prevent the code examples from working as expected.

**Chapter 9**

On page 310, the text that follows Listing 9.23 should be:

>The @Component decorator configures the component. The selector property specifies the HTML element that the directive will be applied to, which is app. The templateUrl property in the @Component **decorator** specifies the content that will be used as the contents of the app element, and, for this example, this property specifies the template.html file.

(Thanks to Piyapan Weesapen for reporting this problem)
